                            <li><strong>Data:</strong> Raw, unprocessed facts and figures that can be processed by a computer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Information:</strong> Processed data that is meaningful and useful for decision-making.</li>
                            <li><strong>Peripheral devices:</strong> External devices connected to a computer, such as a mouse, keyboard, or printer.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Distinguish between analogue and digital computers:</strong> Analogue computers process data represented by continuous physical quantities, while digital computers process data in binary form (0s and 1s).</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Outline three characteristics of third generation computers:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use of integrated circuits, which improved speed and efficiency.</li>
                            <li>Smaller in size compared to previous generations, making them more portable.</li>
                            <li>Increased reliability and lower power consumption.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Differentiate between RAM and ROM:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> Temporary memory used by the computer to store data that is currently being processed; data is lost when power is turned off.</li>
                            <li><strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory):</strong> Permanent memory used to store critical system information, which remains even when the computer is turned off.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>State four disadvantages of computers:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can lead to job displacement as manual tasks become automated.</li>
                            <li>Dependency on electricity and can be expensive to maintain.</li>
                            <li>Risk of cyber-attacks and data breaches.</li>
                            <li>Health issues such as eye strain and back problems due to prolonged use.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
