                    <li><strong>1. What are the advantages of powders as a dosage form?</strong><br>
                        <p>Powders as a dosage form offer the following advantages:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Easy to administer and swallow, especially for patients with difficulty swallowing pills.</li>
                            <li>Faster dissolution rate, leading to quicker absorption and onset of action.</li>
                            <li>Allow for larger doses of medication, which may be challenging in tablet or capsule form.</li>
                            <li>Greater stability for certain drugs compared to liquid forms.</li>
                            <li>Customization is possible, allowing pharmacists to prepare doses tailored to individual patients.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>2. Differentiate between divided and undivided powders.</strong><br>
                        <p>Differences between divided and undivided powders:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Divided powders:</strong> Pre-measured into individual doses, typically packaged in paper or plastic packets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Undivided powders:</strong> Provided in bulk, with patients required to measure each dose themselves.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>3. Describe doubling-up method.</strong><br>
                        <p>The doubling-up method is a compounding technique where a small portion of drug is mixed with an equal amount of excipient. This mixture is then doubled repeatedly until the desired total quantity is reached, ensuring a uniform blend.</p>

                            <li>Allow for modified-release formulations to control drug release over time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>5. Discuss two methods of filling capsules.</strong><br>
